==========

- Had to edit /boot/config.txt and comment out "dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d" to be able to make eglGetDisplay() work, see https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/56124/eglgetdisplay-fails-on-raspberry-3

- next problem: how to prevent display from going into sleep mode
	- temporary workaround: re-enable X server
	- also: example code works even when X server is running
